Introduction
============

What is it?
-----------

Yampee YAML is a PHP library that parses YAML strings and converts them to
PHP arrays. It can also converts PHP arrays to YAML strings.

[YAML](http://www.yaml.org/), YAML Ain't Markup Language, is a human friendly
data serialization standard for all programming languages. YAML is a great
format for your configuration files. YAML files are as expressive as XML files
and as readable as INI files.

### Easy to use

There is only one archive to download, and you are ready to go. No
configuration, No installation. Drop the files in a directory and start using
it today in your projects.

### Open-Source

Released under the MIT license, you are free to do whatever you want, even in
a commercial environment. You are also encouraged to contribute.

### Used by popular Projects

Yampee YAML was initially released as part of the symfony framework, one of
the most popular PHP web framework. It is also embedded in other popular
projects like PHPUnit or Doctrine.

### Documented

Yampee YAML is fully documented, with a dedicated online book, and of course
a full API documentation.

### Fast

One of the goal of Yampee YAML is to find the right balance between speed and
features. It supports just the needed feature to handle configuration files.

### Unit tested

The library is fully unit-tested. With more than 400 unit tests, the library
is stable and is already used in large projects.

### Real Parser

It sports a real parser and is able to parse a large subset of the YAML
specification, for all your configuration needs. It also means that the parser
is pretty robust, easy to understand, and simple enough to extend.

### Clear error messages

Whenever you have a syntax problem with your YAML files, the library outputs a
helpful message with the filename and the line number where the problem
occurred. It eases the debugging a lot.

### Dump support

It is also able to dump PHP arrays to YAML with object support, and inline
level configuration for pretty outputs.

### Types Support

It supports most of the YAML built-in types like dates, integers, octals,
booleans, and much more...

### Full merge key support

Full support for references, aliases, and full merge key. Don't repeat
yourself by referencing common configuration bits.

### PHP Embedding

YAML files are dynamic. By embedding PHP code inside a YAML file, you have
even more power for your configuration files.
